              <p>
                Makati is a city in Metro Manila, Philippines. It is the financial hub of the country and is known for its business-friendly environment. Makati is also home to many restaurants, bars, and shopping centers. It is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The name of Makati originates from the Tagalog word kati, meaning "[of the] low tide" or "[of the] ebb tide", attributing to the tidal movements of the adjacent Pasig River. Alternatively, the word may also mean "itchy", attributed to the lipang kalabaw plant (Dendrocnide meyeniana) that once grew in the area.
